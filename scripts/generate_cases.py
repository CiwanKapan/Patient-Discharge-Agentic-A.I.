"""Generate the stratified synthetic dataset: patient cases, draft answer keys, manifest.

Usage (from repo root):
    python scripts/generate_cases.py                 # 150 + 10 add-on cases, default seeds
    python scripts/generate_cases.py --n 150 --extra 0 --seed 7
    python scripts/generate_cases.py --dev           # the 15-case development set only

The development set (DEV-001 to DEV-015, one case per condition x difficulty)
comes from its own seed and is written to data/dev/ only. It is for pilots and
live checks; it is never part of the evaluation set and does not touch the 160
evaluation cases or data/dataset_manifest.csv.

Writes:
    data/synthetic_cases/CASE-###.json      PatientCase (what the systems see)
    data/answer_keys/CASE-###.key.json      AnswerKey   (hidden from the systems)
    data/dataset_manifest.csv               one row per case, for stratified analysis

Every case is built from a recipe (condition, difficulty, barriers, information
gaps, distractors, near-miss controls, forbidden-tool temptation). The answer key
is derived from the same recipe, so it is consistent by construction, and the
script validates every case and key against src/models and the rules in
tests/test_scenarios.py before writing anything.

The keys are DRAFTS. Per the methodology, a team member other than the case
author must review each key; record the reviewer in the manifest's key_author
and validator columns.

Design rules (see README "Missing Information vs. Incomplete Tasks"):
* Every tracked field is documented unless it is a deliberate information gap.
* A field documented as in_progress / not_started is always a keyed barrier.
* An undocumented field is always keyed as an information gap, never a barrier.
* Cross-field barriers (B-S07, B-E07) cite fields that each look fine alone.
* "Note-only" barriers: the structured field looks fine, but a later free-text
  note supersedes it. Only a system that reads the notes can find them.
* Distractor phrases are written into the free-text notes, not into the case's
  `distractors` list, so the systems meet them the way they would in a chart.
