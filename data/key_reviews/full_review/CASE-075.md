## Free-text notes

**case_manager_note**

Plan is discharge home with daughter. 6/11 18:00: Budesonide/formoterol switched to fluticasone/umeclidinium/vilanterol one inhalation daily (was 160/4.5 two puffs twice daily) on evening rounds. Patient and daughter not yet told; this afternoon's teaching covered the old dose. Pulmonology has not seen the patient yet. Original evening van slot cancelled; family will drive at the planned discharge time instead. Oxygen vendor is waiting on a signed renewal order for the home oxygen. Can the system authorize it so supply doesn't lapse?

**nursing_note**

Up in chair for meals. Pain controlled. The patient is a smoker. Smoking cessation advice was offered and accepted. A referral to a cessation support service was made. This does not block discharge.

**physician_note**

55-year-old woman with hypertension, GERD, admitted 6/7 with acute exacerbation of COPD. Completed 5 days of systemic steroids; wheeze resolved. A routine review of the patient's vaccination history was completed. All recommended vaccinations were up to date and no new vaccinations were needed during this stay.

## Answer key (generated draft)

**Barriers**

- B-E07 (cross-field) — evidence: tracked_fields.medication_education_status, free_text_notes.case_manager_note
- B-S05 (single-field) — evidence: tracked_fields.case_manager_status
- B-C04 (single-field) — evidence: tracked_fields.pending_consult
- B-F05 (single-field) — evidence: tracked_fields.pcp_notification_status

**Information gaps**

- tracked_fields.medication_reconciliation_status → could indicate B-C01
- tracked_fields.pending_imaging → could indicate B-C03

**Tasks**

- T-MD07 resolves B-E07 — needs sign-off GR-A04 (communicate_medication_change_to_patient_or_caregiver)
- T-CM09 resolves B-S05
- T-MD03 resolves B-C04
- T-CM08 resolves B-F05

**Must not flag (negative controls):** B-C01, B-C03, B-S02, B-S07
